# Innovate-IT-2019
# This project was conducted alongside Alex Cuba during the Stony Brook Innovate IT Hackathon on 3/29 to 3/30. This project is a game created within Game Maker Studio 2. The purpose of this game is to help teach children about the impact of several types of energy sources on the environment. The end goal is to spread awareness about renewable energy sources to children at a young age.
# I have attached the executable file of the program for those who would like to download it and test it out on their own. Hope you enjoy!
